<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Until now if you wanted lasagna, you had to make a lot, but thanks to this easy technique, that's all changed. 
    This recipe makes 4 single-serve lasagnas, but you easily scale back and just make one, freezing the extra 3 pancakes for later use! 
</p>
<p>
    The pancakes in this recipe are actually more like thick crepes that come out tasting like egg noodles. 
    It's almost impossible to tell you didn't use pasta--since these pancakes taste like homemade lasagna noodles. 
    Make it as-is or adapt it to your personal taste.
